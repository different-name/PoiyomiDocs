## Getting Started

### VRChat

Make sure you refer to the [VRChat Creators Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/) for setting up your Project and the SDK in Unity. Use the supported Unity Version for VRChat and ensure you're always on the latest version of the VRChat SDK.

After doing so, simply follow the instructions found in [Download & Install](/download) to learn how to begin using the Shader in your Project.

### Other Games

:::info
Poiyomi Shaders is primarily built for usage in VRChat. However, it may be used in non-VRChat projects provided certain conditions are met. See below for details.
:::

If you are a Game Developer or User wishing to use Poiyomi Shaders on a non-VRChat Project, here are the requirements:
- Supported Unity Versions: `2019.4`, `2021.3`, `2022.3 (Recommended)`
- Rendering Pipeline: `Built-in Render Pipeline`
- Build Target: `Windows`

## Version 9.x

All information in this documentation is currently matching the latest publicly-accessible version of Poiyomi Shaders, version `9.0.61` and newer. Therefore, this documentation may not apply at all if you are using a version older than the one indicated here.

If you are on an older version of Poiyomi Shaders, we highly suggest that you read [**our upgrading guidelines**](/docs/general/upgrade/upgrade.md) in order to ensure you are fully up-to-date on the latest features that are documented here.

## Completion Status

This Documentation is continuously being developed! If you have any questions, or if you think you've found an issue, please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and ask! Our goal is to have a fully-fleshed out documentation site with rich visual examples and explanations for all of the shader features.

During the creation of this documentation, however, priority is placed on getting text-based documentation complete first, followed by images and videos, so don't panic if it seems like there's a lot of text for now!
